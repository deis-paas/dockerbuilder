Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

For more information about the Deis Workflow, please visit the main project page at https://github.com/deis/workflow.

We welcome your input! If you have feedback, please [submit an issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and [submit a pull request][prs].

# About

The Dockerbuilder downloads a git archive ([gzip](http://www.gzip.org/)ped [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)ball) from a specified [S3 API compatible server][s3-api] and runs `docker build` on it. When the build is done, it runs `docker push` to push the resulting image to a specified [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) repository.

This component is usually launched by the [Deis Builder](https://github.com/deis/builder) and used inside the Deis [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), but it is flexible enough to be used as a pod inside any Kubernetes cluster.
